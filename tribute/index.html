           <h1>Life of <strong>Alakh panday</strong></h1>
            <p>Alakh Pandey is an Indian physics teacher who is known for his interesting style of teaching. Apart from this, he is also the founder of Edtech company Physics Wallah which has become India’s 101 Unicorn Startup. Pandey Sir was born on 2 October 1991 in South Malaka, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. He completed his early studies at Bishop Johnson School. Alakh had to face a financial crisis in childhood, and to overcome this he started teaching tuition from the eighth grade itself. When he was in class VIII, he used to give tuition to the children of class IV. In the 11th, he started teaching the children of the 9th grade.</p>
            <p>He believed in hard work from the very beginning, so he continued his studies along with tuition. He got 93% marks in his Highschool board examination and after passing the class XII examination in 2010, he started preparing for engineering, but he had to face trouble due to the financial condition of his family. He secured a good rank in the UPSEE entrance exam, due to which he got an opportunity to study engineering at Harcourt Butler Technical Institute (HBTI), Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. He enrolled in B.Tech in Mechanical branch at HBTI Kanpur.</p>
            <p>He topped the entire college by securing 80 percent marks in Physics in the first year of B.Tech. To fulfill his needs in college, he started teaching coaching in B.Tech’s second year. By the third year, his interest in coaching increased and he lost his mind from college studies. He understood that the studies being conducted in the institute are not of much use in real life. So, in the final year of B.Tech, he left his studies and came back to Prayagraj. In 2015 he started teaching on YouTube. Initially, he taught online as well as offline coaching.</p>
            <p>Uploaded videos on the subject of class 12th on YouTube in 2015/16 but it did not work. Then in 2017, when videos were uploaded on the subject of class 10, the children liked it a lot. When he made videos, especially for the children of the ICSE board, initially he got more than 10k subscribers. After monetizing the channel on the advice of a friend, then earning from YouTube also started. Then gradually leaving offline coaching, he started teaching online. Seeing this, in 6 years, the efforts of Alakh Pandey took him from ground to sky.</p>
            <p>Alakh sir’s teaching style is admired not only by the students of the country but from all over the world. Apart from the country, many students in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Dubai watch his videos. A topper from Bangladesh also named Alakh sir in one of his interviews in Bengali. Alakh Pandey Sir, who created a YouTube channel named Physicswallah and then his own company, has reached the top of success today due to his hard work. After facing financial constraints in the beginning, Alakh sir is more worried about those children who are not able to spend more on their studies as they are meritorious.</p>
            <p>He bears the entire cost of that student and helps him a lot to make a better future. Now his company Physicswallah (PW) is preparing to provide educational material in nine languages ​​in the coming time. His company PW is preparing to reach out to Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Odia, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Kannada-speaking students. The company’s objective behind this is to reach every part of the country and connect more than 2.5 billion students to its platform by 2025. Apart from this, the PW team of Alakh Pandey is also very active in social work.</p>
